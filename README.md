In this project, we are going to predict whether or not credit card is fraudulent or legit by using machine learning

The data set is taken from the website kaddle https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/mlg-ulb/creditcardfraud.

A total of 284 806 transections in total of which 492 are fraudulent transections. This implies that the data we are using is highly unbalanced as 0.173% of the transections made are fraudulent
